# My Neovim Configuration Files
- It is full-fledged, way faster than vsc, also look better
- I suggest use Fira Mono/Hack as your terminal's font
- most shortcuts in ./lua/core.lua

## Install

```shell
# install packer.nvim first

cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/Ji-Xinyou/my.nvim.git nvim # drink some tea

nvim
:PackerSync # drink some tea
```

## IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. You need to install **ripgrep** to use telescope's live grep
2. Run `:TSUpdate` to update/install treesitter stuff
